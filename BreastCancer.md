## Project Overview

This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on a variety of features. Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- SVM model training
- Model evaluation and tuning using GridSearchCV

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) from Kaggle.

- **Features:** 30 features computed from a digitized image of a breast mass.
- **Target:** Binary classification where 'M' stands for malignant and 'B' stands for benign.

### Columns
- **Input Features:** Various attributes such as `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `smoothness_mean`, etc.
- **Target Feature:** Diagnosis (`M` for malignant, `B` for benign).

## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
